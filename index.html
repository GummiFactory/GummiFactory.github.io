excerpt: "A printable and variable-stiffness GummiArm. Starting at â‚¬7750."

intro:
  - excerpt: 'GummiArm is an open source, bio-inspired robotic arm for education and research. You can build your own GummiArm, or order it all ready to be deployed to your laboratory and start using it with no delay.'

    title: "Simply replicable"
    excerpt: 'Replicate and extend research experiments on embodied cognitive robotics.
Or make GummiArm your bench for demonstrating concepts accross the whole STEAM range at higher education or high school.'

    title: "Variable passive compliance"
    excerpt: 'GummiArm is a bio-inspired robotic arm which follows the human muscle-tendon system design principle known in the robotics community as Variable Stiffness Actuation, in an agonist-antagonist configuration, enabling control over both, the bandwidth and stiffness during actuation.'
