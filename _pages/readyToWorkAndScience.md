    excerpt: 'GummiArm allows researchers in the Embodied Intelligence, Cognitive Robotics or Developmental Robotics communities to implement models that could not be implemented in standard robotic arms. <br /> <br />GummiArm can outsource computation to the physical body, making the realisation of many tasks easier than when using classical control and computation models.<br /> <br /> Running experiments on a system where intelligence emerges from the interaction between the body and the environment is possible with GummiArm.<br /> <br /> Stiffness and damping specification.'
