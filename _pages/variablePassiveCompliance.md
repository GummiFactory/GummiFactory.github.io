    excerpt: 'The GummiArm is a novel robotic arm which can vary its passive compliance (or softness) through its agonist-antagonist actuator-tendon configuration. That is, with the ability to co-contract muscles to increase joint stiffness. A bit like you and I, in other words.<br><br> This means that it can afford exotic behaviours such as shock absorption, energy storage during motion (throwing), stiffness variation in real-time, and more.<br><br> Such features seem key to enable robots to co-exist and co-operate with people on the one hand, and to get closer to the human levels of manipulation, on the other hand, [(Vanderborght et al., 2013)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889013001188){:target="_blank"}.<br> <br>The technology also makes the GummiArm robust to unpredicted or unpredictable perturbations, while affording adaptability and accuracy when needed. More details on these features can be found in [(Stoelen et al., 2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303881123_Co-Exploring_Actuator_Antagonism_and_Bio-Inspired_Control_in_a_Printable_Robot_Arm){:target="_blank"}.'
