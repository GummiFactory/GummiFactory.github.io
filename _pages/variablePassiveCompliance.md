    excerpt: 'GummiArm is a novel robotic arm which uses the Variable Passive Compliance (VPC) principle in an agonist-antagonist configuration.<br /> <br /> This means that it affords the realisation of use cases such as Shock Absorption, Explosive Motion, Stiffness Variation and Cyclic Motion.<br /> These features are key to enable robots to co-exist and co-operate with people on the one hand, and to get closer to the human levels of manipulation, on the other hand, (Vanderborght et al., Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 2013).<br /> <br />Additionally, VPC technology makes GummiArm robust to unpredicted or unpredictable perturbations, while affording adaptability and force accuracy.'
